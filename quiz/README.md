# Gophercises Marathon
20 Go programming excercises in 20 days :)

### Background
I've been picking up Go and recently discoverd Jon Calhoun's [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/). If you're not familiar, Gophercises is a free course containing 20 software dev excercises along with solutions in the Go programming language. The projects are nontrivial (at least to a new gopher) and motivate concepts like

- Channels
- Mutexes
- Goroutines
- Functional Options
- Chaining Interfaces
- Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages)
- Reading input from the command line

I was able to learn goroutines, channels, and a bunch of standard library stuff from just the first project for example. 
### The plan
To make the most of the course I've decided to complete it as a 20 day challenge.
For the next 20 days, I will be attempting to complete one gophercise per day according to the schedule below.
