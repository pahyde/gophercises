# Gophercises (Marathon)
20 Go programming excercises in 20 days :)

### Background
I've been picking up Go and recently discoverd Jon Calhoun's [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/). If you're not familiar, Gophercises is a free course containing 20 software development excercises along with solutions in the Go programming language. The projects are nontrivial (at least to a new gopher) and motivate concepts like

- Channels
- Mutexes
- Goroutines
- Functional Options
- Chaining Interfaces
- Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages)
- Reading input from the command line

I was able to learn goroutines, channels, and a bunch of standard library stuff from just the first project for example. 
### The plan
Good project-based learning material is hard to come by. To make the most of the course, I've decided to complete it as a 20 day challenge.
Specifically, I'll try to complete one gophercise per day for the next 20 days according to the schedule/checklist below.

As always it's about the journey and not the destination. This is a pretty ambitious pace but I'm thinking I can make it happen. Either way I'm looking forward to learning from successes and failures!
