os, flag, csv
timer: time, channels, goroutines

part 1: no timer
    - read questions from csv 
        - col format: question, answer
    - stdout: score -> something like "7/12"

Lessons:
    1) Convert composite data types (slices, maps, etc) returned from external io sources to
    named struct types for internal use. This allows easier integration with other formats
    representing the same information.

part 2: timer
    - concurrency 
    - cancel immediately if time runs out
